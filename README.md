# KMPH to MPH converter
runs two kmph to mph converters.

One of them just multiplies kmph times 0.621 to produce mph.
The other multiplies by 60 to determine kilometers and then multiplies that by 0.621 to determine miles. Will then divide by 60 to determine MPH. 

it's not the most practical thing to use the longer version. I just wanted to experiment to see what it would look like/take to run it a longer/more accurate way. 

I updated it to ask for mph to kmph or mph to kmph. will update.
